Hay to be more specific. This was the missing piece, this was what we needed to take our farm from being a broken, un-productive ecosystem to being system that really works.

And it turns out grazing in the summer and hay for the winter the missing piece of agriculture in a broader way.

While grazing is still practiced on a large scale in areas with poorer land, the richest soils are relentlessly cropped with a more valueable crop like corn or soybeans. This wouldn't be possible without the use of agri-chemicals, but even with their help soils are slowly degrading. Why is this? Prennial forages have a unique ability to build soils.

Forages cover soils, thereby protecting them inevitable erosion that wears away on tilled cropland. Meanwhile the grazing animals generously donate their manure which is readily incorporated into the soil by earthworms and an army of beneficial bugs.

The creates a system literally pulls carbon and nitrogen from the air and creates deep, rich topsoil. And the icing on the cake is a few extra animals
